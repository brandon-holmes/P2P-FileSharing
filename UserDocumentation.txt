P2P Server(P2PServer.java): Matthew Sacco 500574287
P2P Client(p2pclient.java): Brandon Holmes 500751878
DHT Server Pool (directoryServer.java): Brandon Holmes 500751878/Daniel Watchon 500761335

In order to run the program:
1) On any machine, run directoryServer.java first, using any IDE or javac/java commands
2) On any machine, run first P2PServer.java, and then p2pclient.java with the given arg: directoryServer IP, whatever that may be (ex: 192.0.2.1)
3) Repeat step 2 to create more P2P client/servers, on as many machines as wanted.
4) Follow the instructions given by the p2pclient.java, the DHT servers start with 0 entries so in order for any entries to be valid at leastone
   p2pclient must use the "U" command to upload at least one file
5) Repeat step 4 with up to 15 files per client.
6) In order to find a certain file use the "Q" query input on any client to search for a specific file name, this will return the IP of where the file is stored
7) Using the given IP from query and the file name searched, use the "D" command in any client followed by inputting the IP and file name to download 
   the file from the given IP address.
8) In order to exit and delete all entries from a certain client use the "E" command to clear the entries from the DHT pool and end the program.
